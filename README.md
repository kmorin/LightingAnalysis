Lighting Analysis Tools for Revit
=================================

Tools for performing photometric calculations in Revit

*Currenly supports point by point calculation within Spaces. -- Only one space per view (right now) -- Data for light fixtures are pulled out of the Type settings (not the IES files yet)
*Still working on updating the code to allow true updating of Analysis Primitives (right now leaves old one and adds new one)
*Need help testing various configurations and room layouts to verify accuracy
*Need help improving code and forumlas

#### Roadmap
* Add features to make production ready for producing point-by-point calc drawing submittals.
* Perform calcs on multiple spaces in single view.
